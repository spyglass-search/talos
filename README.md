## talos

Talos is meant to be a powerful interface to easily create automated workflows
that uses large language models (LLMs) to parse, extract, summarize, etc. different
types of content and push it to other APIs/databases/etc.

Think [Zapier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapier) but with language model magic ðŸª„.

## Example Workflows

### Extract data from a web page.

[View workflow](./docs/examples/webpage-extract.png)

1. Fetch this wikipedia page.
2. Extract who the page is about, give a summary, and extract any topics discussed.
3. Put into a template.

### Read a Yelp review and tell me about it.

1. Read this Yelp review
2. Extract the sentiment and give me a list of complaints and/or praises
3. Put into a report template.
4. Email it to me.

### Summarize this book & generate a book report.

1. Read through this PDF file.
2. Create a bullet point summary of the entire book.
3. Generate key takeaways from the book
   3a. For each takeaway, elaborate
4. Combine into a template.

## Running Locally

To start running `talos` locally, install the dependencies

```bash
# Copy the environment variables
> cp .env.template .env.local
# Install dependencies
> npm install
# Start the front-end
> npm run start
```

The UI will be available at [http://localhost:3000/playground](http://localhost:3000/playground).

Now we need to start the backend.

### Using w/ memex

[memex](https://github.com/spyglass-search/memex) is a self-hosted LLM backend & memory store
that exposes a bunch of basic functionality as a RESTful API.

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/spyglass-search/memex
> cd memex
> docker-compose up
```
